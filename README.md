## Introduction

Mango-Bytes 2.0 is a make believe e-commerce store that developers can spend money
and improve their skills in different programming languages, frameworks, technologies.
Developers can also spend money to buy merch, swag, and super powers. This is the
2nd version of Mango-Bytes. It was my capston project at General Assembly's Coding
Bootcamp, Web Development Immersive. At the time, I wanted to make the website using
React, but 1 week was not enough time for this project. I am currently working on it
when I am free from CS homeworks at Boston University.

## Introduction

Mango-Bytes 2.0 is a make believe e-commerce store that developers can spend money
and improve their skills in different programming languages, frameworks, technologies.
Developers can also spend money to buy merch, swag, and super powers. This is the
2nd version of Mango-Bytes. It was my capston project at General Assembly's Coding
Bootcamp, Web Development Immersive. At the time, I wanted to make the website using
React. However I had to learn react, learn react-router, and learn redux. 1 week was not enough time for this project. I work on it with whatever free time I have at Boston University.

## Development Process

  Since this was a redo of a previous project, I used previous project's wireframes,
code, and ideas. The previous project did not incorporate React, React-Redux,
and React Router. I had to modify pre-existing code. Before this project, I did not
know how to use React Router and React Redux. Before writing code for this project,
I took a Udemy lesson on Redux. Then I read the documentations for React Router and
React Redux.
